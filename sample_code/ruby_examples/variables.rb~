# Variables act similar to variables in Java.
# In Ruby, though, all variables hold objects.  There are no "primitives" like
# int, char, etc.
# Variables are case-sensitive.  FOO, fOo, and foo are all different variables.
# Variables are generally snake_case (all lowercase, words separated by underscores)

my_name = "Bill" # String
my_age = 38 # Integer
num_children = 1.0 # Float

# Ruby is dynamically typed - types are inferred at runtime
# Note there is nothing stopping us from doing this

# This will print out (PUT String) the class of the my_age object
puts my_age.class # Will print out Integer
my_age = "Laboon"

# my_age used to store an Integer, but now it stores a String
# This is actually very dangerous and a common cause of issues in complex
# Ruby programs!  You send an Integer when it expects a Float, for instance.
puts my_age.class # Will now print out String
