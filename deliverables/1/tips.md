1. Be as precise as possible.  Don't write "Ensure that you see the correct value"; write exactly what value you expect to see.  Don't write "place a checker in a column"; state specifically which column.

2. Remember to put down all the necessary steps and preconditions!

3. The "Description" label is for a description of the test case in plain English.  For example, "Ensure that a horizontal row of X's, with no flipping or rotating, wins for X."

4. You do not need to exhaustively test the application!  If you find yourself with more than three or four test cases per requirement, you may be over-testing.  This is admirable in software where human life is at stake, but this is only your grade.

5. This is a test plan, not a test run - remember the difference.  If you do not know, read the book!

6. Remember that tests should be reproducible - starting with all preconditions met, anybody should be able to reproduce the same steps and get the same results.  If they can't, rethink your preconditions!

7. I recommend writing up your test plan, traceability matrix, and defects first.  Then go through the code and try to fix the defects that you found.  You may also want to commit after you fix each defect, just in case you mess something up while trying to fix the next one.
